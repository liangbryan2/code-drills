10 stacks of 10 coins
obviously can weigh 10 times
5, 5  half
2, 2,  half
1, 1  half
That's 3.

1? hmmmmm

counterfeit coin weighs 11, normal weighs 10
split the stacks to weigh portions
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 add them all up its 55,
if they were all real they would weigh 550 grams,
but one of the stacks is counterfeit so you can find the stack by looking at the end sum
if stack one is counterfeit, the total would be 551,
if stack two is counterfeit, total would be 552,
etc.
3, 553
4, 554..
then you find your counterfeit stack
