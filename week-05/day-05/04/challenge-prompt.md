weigh 4 coins on each side,
the lighter one contains the counterfeit,
weigh 2 coins on each side,
the lighter one contains the counterfeit, 
weigh 1 coin on each side,
you found the counterfeit.





2 times? hm
weigh 3 coins on each side, if one side has a counterfeit it'll weigh less, if neither of the 6 coins contain the counterfeit, the two you didn't weigh contain the counterfeit,
weigh 1 coin on each side, if it is apart of the 3 coins you weighed earlier, the lighter one or the one you didn't weigh is the counterfeit.
